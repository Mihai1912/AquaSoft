After complaining , nearly begging, we got another room. \nThere was no relaxing at the pool, music so loud we could not hear each other anymore and nowhere was a place to sit somewhere quiet. No escape!!\nYour information on the site does not mention it is not a hotel for every customer. It preaches ‚Äúrelaxation‚Äù for people conducting business, but it is a hotel for big families with children.\nThe rooms are okay, nothing special compared to other hotels. The bed is extremely hard and uncomfortable.\nI would not recommend this hotel to others and will never return. There is enough choice of good hotels in Dubai. This one is certainly not one of them.","Helpful Votes":0,"Photos":null,"Stay Date":"2025-06-30","Created Date":"2025-06-07","Published Date":"2025-06-07","Language":"en","Location":"Vida Emirates Hills","Location Id":16735551,"URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d16735551-r1011490263-Vida_Emirates_Hills-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"},{"Review Id":1011475137,"User ID":"C886E0BEC726003C88A3BE587A605B83","Display Name":"Afzaal A","User Name":"153afzaala","User Profile":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/153afzaala","User Avatar":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg","User Location":null,"User Is Verified":"No","Rating":5,"Additional Ratings":"Value:5\nRooms:5\nLocation:5\nCleanliness:5\nService:5\nSleep Quality:5","Review Title":"Homw away to home","Review Text":"Mukesh is an excellent service provider!
