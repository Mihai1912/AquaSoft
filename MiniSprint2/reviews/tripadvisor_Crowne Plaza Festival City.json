If you want to experience what World class customer service is, I would recommend the Crowne Plaza Hotel.  From the transfer from the airport to the check-in experience and the breakfast, I have been met with nothing but perfection.  I have only been in country for 2 hours and if for nothing else, I would return to experience the servitude mindset the rest of the world should strive to match.","Helpful Votes":0,"Photos":null,"Stay Date":"2025-06-30","Created Date":"2025-06-10","Published Date":"2025-06-09","Language":"en","Location":"Crowne Plaza Dubai - Festival City, an IHG hotel","Location Id":754106,"URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d754106-r1011909038-Crowne_Plaza_Dubai_Festival_City_an_IHG_hotel-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"},{"Review Id":908060163,"User ID":"F493D8FEF45E0A051DCA4E97DF3C50D2","Display Name":"Hotel Heart","User Name":"HotelHeart","User Profile":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HotelHeart","User Avatar":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/28/b4/7d/19/hotelheart.jpg","User Location":"San Francisco","User Is Verified":"No","Rating":5,"Additional Ratings":"Value:5\nLocation:5\nService:5","Review Title":"Great Service and Amazing View in Festival City","Review Text":"1.\tHotel Location:\nAs part of our recent trip to Dubai in UAE, we stayed at the Crowne Plaza Dubai - Festival City for Seven nights. The hotel is located in the heart of the city in Dubai Festival City at a convenient location. It is located just 8 km from the Burj Khalifa, 7.5 km away from Dubai Mall, and just 2 km from Dubai International Airport. It is connected to one of the best Malls in Dubai (i.e., Festival City Mall) with a walk of 12 to 15 minutes. This connection made our day. The waterfront rooms have an amazing view of the sea and you would enjoy seeing the boats’ lights at night.\n\n2.\tFacilities of the hotel:\nThe 5-star Crowne Plaza Dubai - Festival City can accommodate both leisure and business tourists. The hotel offers rooms and suites on 19 floors, including standard rooms, waterfront view rooms, and suites spread across its 19 floors. Some of them have city views and others come with an amazing waterfront view. In addition to its luxurious rooms and suites, the hotel offers a wide range of amenities and activities to its visitors. There are two swimming pools (one small for kids) on the 5th floor and a fitness center. The pool opens from 7am to 8pm and there is a pool guard who provides towels and free waters. Guests can use the pools in the Intercontinental Dubai festival city as well. In addition, there was some renovation work in the main restaurant, however, we had breakfasts in the restaurant located at the ground floor. Moreover, there is a bank ATM machine available in the hotel if you want to withdraw some cash.\n\nAs soon as we entered the hotel reception, we were completely taken aback by the support from bell boys and Concierge. Guests and other visitors can park their cars in the free self-parking area or request Concierge to park their cars as well. Most importantly, the hotel is connected to Dubai’s Festival City Mall with a walk of 12 to 15 minutes. This connection made our day as we laterally do not move our car.\n\n3.\tFabulous Rooms with Astonishing Waterfront View:\nThe Waterfront room is big and spotless. Room Design was and atmosphere was excellent. The rooms are always clean. Each room has either one large bed or two single beds which are all very comfortable. The room has a fantastic view of the waterfront and the boats at nights as well as Burj Khalifa. The room is 34m2 and can easily accommodate 3 adults or 2 adults with two children. We requested extra bed, however, the room still big enough. It features a bedroom with a bath, sofa, an air conditioning, Flat screen LCD TVs with various channels, an iron, an iron table, a working desk, a coffee machine, safety box, a fridge with free water, and complimentary toiletries. The room does not have balcony. However, the view from the room was breathtaking (Waterfront view).\n\nThe bathroom is big enough. It includes a bathtub within a rain shower half enclosure. The soap, shower gel, shampoo, and hair conditioner are all of a great quality. I honestly liked the smell of the shower gel. There are many towels offered, including hand, body, and facial towels. One sink and a big mirror are in the main bathroom. Toilet paper and facial tissue are both of good quality. Moreover, there is water shut off in the bathroom. The hotel also offers complimentary slippers as well as tooth brush and bastes in a daily basis. \n\n4.\tTasty and diversified Breakfast:\nWe tried the breakfast at the main restaurant which is located at ground floor. The breakfast was available from 6:30 am to 11:00 am every day. It was delicious and diverse. When you have your breakfast, you'll be enjoying the food and therefore won't have to worry about counting calories. As said, Healthy food feeds and warms the heart and spirit.\n\nThere are various sections in the restaurant for the buffet breakfast. A section for fresh orange juice, drinks and fruits is included in the restaurant's buffet. The breakfast buffet also includes sections for Asian cousin, breads & waffles, salad, cheese, hot sections and a live station with many cocks. I advise trying the Omelet which is prepared by Chef Mohammed Al Husari. You will not regret it. I also recommend the cheese pie as well as Zatar pie.\n\n5.\tExcellent staff:\nThe hotel’s staff have made your experience more memorable. Excellent and welcoming service was provided by the Crowne Plaza Dubai - Festival City. You feel the international standards of Crowne Plaza reflected in the attitude and services quality. The check-in and check-out processes went seamless. The staff provides great hospitality and service quality. We were warmly welcomed, and they were quite accommodating with good customer service. The staff is incredibly friendly, respectful, and accommodating. They will never hesitate to help in any form and they consistently keep you happy. It is undoubtedly true that \" It is good people who make good places\".\nMany thanks to the following individuals for your support while I was there:\n- Leadership: Mohammed Faid, Don, Aimee, Suzana Shaban, and Juliana Khalifa\n- Reservation: Zehera Miftah\n- Front desk/ bell boys: Arun (supervisor), Aushi, Islam and Man Kumar\n- Housekeeping: Christopher, Rahan, and Zubair\n- Concierge/Parking: Frender, Lakbir, Dinish, Ghulam, & Zahoor\n- Operator: Badika, Jelani, Ajan, Imanweel, Sajan, & Abbo\n- Restaurant: Victor, Karam, Jowana, Mumammed Habib (trainee)m Alth (cook), Ahmed (supervisor), Chef Mohammed Al Husari, Janipa, Vikram, Ulu, Fayz, Faizan, & Salah\n- Room service: Nawras\n- Technician / Maintenance: Deeleb and Sabi\n\nIn conclusion:\nOverall, we had a fantastic time at the Crowne Plaza Dubai - Festival City and appreciated the warmth. The hotel and staff exceeded our expectations. The facilities were fantastic, and the location is excellent. The staff was very good and the rooms were spotless and quite comfy with great view of the sea. We have received a good service from every single departments with no exception.\n\nThe Crowne Plaza Dubai - Festival City is a fantastic spot for people to unwind and enjoy relaxing stay, great view and good service quality. Hence, I would certainly and strongly recommend staying there with no hesitation.","Helpful Votes":2,"Photos":null,"Stay Date":"2023-07-31","Created Date":"2023-08-05","Published Date":"2023-08-05","Language":"en","Location":"Crowne Plaza Dubai - Festival City, an IHG hotel","Location Id":754106,"URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d754106-r908060163-Crowne_Plaza_Dubai_Festival_City_an_IHG_hotel-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"},{"Review Id":1011618555,"User ID":"11CE4547FCAC5BEB7DF9D316C4B15964","Display Name":"Lujain A","User Name":"847lujaina","User Profile":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/847lujaina","User Avatar":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg","User Location":null,"User Is Verified":"No","Rating":5,"Additional Ratings":"Value:5\nRooms:5\nLocation:5\nCleanliness:5\nService:5\nSleep Quality:5","Review Title":"Everything was comfortable","Review Text":"Everything was comfortable starting from good service, clean rooms, nice staff, perfect location, tasty food with a lot of varieties and I would like to  thank o-swam at the reception he was very helpful.\nThe pool is small that's the only thing that I could be a no for me.","Helpful Votes":0,"Photos":null,"Stay Date":"2025-06-30","Created Date":"2025-06-08","Published Date":"2025-06-08","Language":"en","Location":"Crowne Plaza Dubai - Festival City, an IHG hotel","Location Id":754106,"URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d754106-r1011618555-Crowne_Plaza_Dubai_Festival_City_an_IHG_hotel-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"},{"Review Id":1011305947,"User ID":"4EE24F746B7FABEECD9AC5E420757F49","Display Name":"Pixel P","User Name":"829pixelp","User Profile":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/829pixelp","User Avatar":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ec/a2/default-avatar-2020-3.jpg","User Location":null,"User Is Verified":"No","Rating":5,"Additional Ratings":"Value:4\nRooms:4\nLocation:5\nCleanliness:5\nService:5\nSleep Quality:4","Review Title":"Pleasant sunny holidays","Review Text":"Bedding ok\nCleanliness ok\nHighlights: \nThe hyper attentive staff smiling and very professional, special mention to Indi at the desk \nBreakfast buffet ok\nSmall attention on this day of Eid Mubarak to children \nKids club ok\nProximity to mall festival city","Helpful Votes":0,"Photos":null,"Stay Date":"2025-06-30","Created Date":"2025-06-06","Published Date":"2025-06-05","Language":"en","Location":"Crowne Plaza Dubai - Festival City, an IHG hotel","Location Id":754106,"URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d754106-r1011305947-Crowne_Plaza_Dubai_Festival_City_an_IHG_hotel-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"},{"Review Id":1011281498,"User ID":"2C28A2051522984C00E9541F0E843E56","Display Name":"yazeed s","User Name":"19yazeeds","User Profile":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/19yazeeds","User Avatar":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f2/eb/default-avatar-2020-27.jpg","User Location":null,"User Is Verified":"No","Rating":5,"Additional Ratings":"Value:5\nRooms:5\nLocation:5\nCleanliness:5\nService:5\nSleep Quality:5","Review Title":"Wonderful state in the Crowne Plaza, Hotel","Review Text":"My experience in this hotel was so wonderful.

We loved the food, such a great variety & labelled with allergens. The fact that water was complimentary during dinner was a pleasant surprise & very appreciated.\n\nI have a gluten free diet & I found breakfast to be unaccommodating! I emailed the hotel before my arrival & then mentioned it again on our first morning at breakfast. They only had bread, no cereals, no biscuits, no cakes. The next morning still nothing available. I ended up going to the supermarket in the mall & purchasing some biscuits. It wasn’t until our 5th morning that I was given some cookies from a packet. In a 5 star hotel in Dubai this was not acceptable. I have stayed in 3 star hotels where they have prepared me crepes/pancakes. There was no offer of any kind at Crowne Plaza which was disappointing. I felt like I was inconveniencing the staff which left me feeling embarrassed & awkward.","Helpful Votes":0,"Photos":null,"Stay Date":"2025-04-30","Created Date":"2025-05-25","Published Date":"2025-05-25","Language":"en","Location":"Crowne Plaza Dubai - Festival City, an IHG hotel","Location Id":754106,"URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d754106-r1009143661-Crowne_Plaza_Dubai_Festival_City_an_IHG_hotel-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"}]
