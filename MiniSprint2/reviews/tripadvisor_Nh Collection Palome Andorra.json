We haven’t stayed many fancy places so this felt fancy to us but may be dependent on expectation. The room was clean, spacious and comfortable. We loved having a balcony and looking over the river. \nThe service made this hotel 5*. It was my birthday when we stayed and my partner emailed prior to arriving to ask if they could do anything at all as a little surprise for my birthday. On my bday we arrived back at the hotel after a day of skiing to find a chocolate brownie with a candle on slate saying happy birthday with strawberries too. We also made an error when skiing a different resort where we forgot about our shoes to change into from boots. The hotel provides us slippers when they noticed despite us not paying for a room with these extras. It might seem standard for some hotel guests but we appreciated the touches. \nThe hotel is perfect for anyone skiing Arinsal however you must be fit, it’s an uphill walk around 15min up to the gondola. It was tiring but we were happier to do this than pay expense for being next to the gondola. Plus this hotel is much fancier than others in Arinsal which my partner has stayed in. \nBeautiful area I would highly recommend staying here.","Helpful Votes":0,"Photos":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/fd/59/0d/caption.jpg","Stay Date":"2024-02-29","Created Date":"2024-04-29","Published Date":"2024-04-29","Language":"en","Location":"NH Collection Andorra Palomé","Location Id":265416,"URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g28076681-d265416-r948813164-NH_Collection_Andorra_Palome-Puiol_del_Piu_La_Massana_Parish.html"},{"Review Id":942207027,"User ID":"1146A71B0DC6AF7E6818F20AAED4433C","Display Name":"Aloha","User Name":"idealdiction","User Profile":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/idealdiction","User Avatar":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/e7/99/default-avatar-2020-57.jpg","User Location":null,"User Is Verified":"No","Rating":5,"Additional Ratings":"Value:5\nLocation:5\nService:5","Review Title":"Ideal place to disconnect","Review Text":"The stay was excellent, as was the reception.

We have experienced the first family management, the second professional management and now this management in the hands of a prestigious chain. In reality there is only one employee left from the old days, but we are still customers.\n\nThe truth is that there have been some changes, some like them more, others less, but we are still customers so we can say that the hotel continues to be one of the best options in Andorra. With membership of the NH group, breakfast has greatly improved, truly an aspect worth highlighting. The treatment remains the same as always, that is, exquisite and very attentive.\n\nWe will say that the facilities remain the same at a general level and the hotel is well renovated. Modern and correct. Perhaps, and only as constructive criticism, there are two details that prevent me from giving the highest rating and they are the following:\n\n1. Double beds too small. It would be good to raise this issue because there are really centimeters missing and it is not normal in a 4-star hotel for double beds to be narrow in size.\n\n2. Paying for parking only has one qualification, ridiculous.\nThat an open-air parking in a mountain hotel far from the urban center requires payment and forces clients who do not agree with this to park on the road is absurd. It is therefore normal that this is generating so much criticism because it really does not make sense, especially considering that it had always been free. Rectifying is wise....","Helpful Votes":1,"Photos":null,"Stay Date":"2023-06-30","Created Date":"2023-08-16","Published Date":"2023-08-16","Language":"en","Location":"NH Collection Andorra Palomé","Location Id":265416,"URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g28076681-d265416-r910737490-NH_Collection_Andorra_Palome-Puiol_del_Piu_La_Massana_Parish.html"},{"Review Id":907425772,"User ID":"F80FEF5A8580F69D4A99594EFEFEC0C0","Display Name":"javier649","User Name":"javier649","User Profile":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/javier649","User Avatar":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/76/8f/9c/javier649.jpg","User Location":"Province of Castellon","User Is Verified":"No","Rating":1,"Additional Ratings":"Value:5\nRooms:5\nLocation:5\nCleanliness:5\nService:5\nSleep Quality:5","Review Title":"Very expensive parking","Review Text":"In a 4-star hotel, it should at least have one detail and have a free car in its facilities. A parking lot that is just a piece of concrete or asphalt. It is not protected from the sun, rain or snow. It seems to me that €15 per night to leave your car is a crazy price for nothing. Just leave it out there in inclement weather. Sun, rain and snow or hail. If I had been protected indoors I would have paid it, but if it is the same as being on the street, it seems very expensive to me.","Helpful Votes":0,"Photos":null,"Stay Date":"2023-07-31","Created Date":"2023-08-02","Published Date":"2023-08-02","Language":"en","Location":"NH Collection Andorra Palomé","Location Id":265416,"URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g28076681-d265416-r907425772-NH_Collection_Andorra_Palome-Puiol_del_Piu_La_Massana_Parish.html"}]
