I think it's the 5th time we've been to \"our\" hotel. \n\nVery spacious and comfortable rooms and the one we get almost always, very bright because there is a person with low vision in addition to being PMR. Very comfortable beds and pillows. Oh and the towels always thick and quality. And the perfect cleaning. \n\nAs always, the treatment and attention, excellent. \n\nFirst of all, THANKS to Lucas from reception for attending my request for the room, for the bunk beds, for the brightness for a person with low vision and for the wheelchair, it is much more comfortable and spacious for our stay.\n\nAlso Andrea for her diligence to resolve any incidents.\n\nSpecial mention to Yovana , Luis and Izan, of the dinner shift (I hope I have spelled the names well, although I doubt it!!) for their closeness , sympathy, good treatment , be a charm and be aware of everything and everyone, ah and also to Juan Carlos, who forgot about him. \n\nThis time I would improve the dinner menu, although there is a lot of variety, I have not found it as palatable as before (too much fish that we like little at home) and I have missed the brownie (hope to see it next time). I know you're already on it. The croquettes and fritters must be fixed because they are very good and taste like three or four, I think before they came in more. The encore must also be fixed, it is delicious. \n\nBreakfast is perfect, there is everything (cold, hot, sweet and salty), I have seen new donuts and some more pastries, which is appreciated for people as sweet as us. \n\nIf I may, I would suggest for winter and as a starter, soups and creams, which always go well and fancy the cold and also dishes with seasonal vegetables such as pumpkin, beans or artichokes, calçots, etc.  I think it might be an option to consider in winter. \n\nThank you very much to the whole team for making our stay so comfortable once again and attending to my requests. \n\nI hope we can continue going to Andorra and your hotel.\n\nSee you soon.","Helpful Votes":0,"Photos":null,"Stay Date":"2025-03-31","Created Date":"2025-03-28","Published Date":"2025-03-28","Language":"en","Location":"Hotel Exe Prisma","Location Id":594097,"URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190401-d594097-r1000186934-Hotel_Exe_Prisma-Escaldes_Engordany_Escaldes_Engordany_Parish.html"},{"Review Id":986948044,"User ID":"4DAE4845E32D3902E055079D259E349E","Display Name":"Gloria D","User Name":"gloriad182","User Profile":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gloriad182","User Avatar":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg","User Location":null,"User Is Verified":"No","Rating":3,"Additional Ratings":"","Review Title":"Correct and well located facilities, very unfriendly staff","Review Text":"The rooms are very large, clean and more than right.

So I did and without problems they took note and told me to call the parking intercom on arrival. I did so and my surprise was that on arrival the receptionist told me that I had been misinformed and that it must be booked on arrival and that the parking lot was full. Obviously I refused to accept the answer and told him that two of his colleagues had given me different information.\n- The rooms with bunk beds for children have it right at the entrance of the room, the door is not acoustically isolated and if you are on the 1st or 2nd floor you hear all the conversations of the reception staff (and that afternoon the man and woman who were working did not stop talking to each other), we got the bad son and it was an odyssey.\n- For more inri on one side of the hotel comes all the noise of a disco, so we had the perfect night.\n\nNext time we go back to Andorra we'll go to another hotel","Helpful Votes":0,"Photos":null,"Stay Date":"2024-07-31","Created Date":"2024-09-01","Published Date":"2024-09-01","Language":"en","Location":"Hotel Exe Prisma","Location Id":594097,"URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190401-d594097-r967774959-Hotel_Exe_Prisma-Escaldes_Engordany_Escaldes_Engordany_Parish.html"},{"Review Id":967670261,"User ID":"01C6A8DA411AE3D27F3029ABCE8A3C8E","Display Name":"cubabella41","User Name":"cubabella41","User Profile":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cubabella41","User Avatar":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg","User Location":null,"User Is Verified":"No","Rating":4,"Additional Ratings":"Value:5\nRooms:4\nLocation:5\nCleanliness:5\nService:5\nSleep Quality:5","Review Title":"HOTEL TO REPEAT WITHOUT HESITATION","Review Text":"SUPER LARGE AND CLEAN ROOMS SUPER COMFORTABLE BEDS, FRIENDLY AND COOPERATIVE STAFF, DINNERS ARE KITCHEN OF AUTHOR HAHA SMALL AMOUNTS AND WITH COMBINATION OF RARE FLAVORS BUT YOU HAVE TO TASTE , THE ROOM OF THE BUNK BEDS THERE IS NO WAY TO WATCH THE TV LYING DOWN I THINK THEY COULD PUT ARMS TO THE TV TO BE ABLE TO MOVE IT BUT TO THE CHAIR GROUNDED, THE BATHROOM OF THAT ROOM IS WET OUTSIDE EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE DOOR ALREADY SAID IN RECEPTION BUT IT WAS NOT SOLVED.

Awful. I mentioned it at reception and 2 days later I received a call from Mr. Francesc apologizing and asking that he please not publish a negative review in exchange for a 1-day stay.\nMr. Francesc gave you the hotel because it is horrible and I am still waiting for your call.","Helpful Votes":0,"Photos":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2b/18/ab/c1/caption.jpg","Stay Date":"2023-10-31","Created Date":"2023-12-27","Published Date":"2023-12-27","Language":"en","Location":"Hotel Exe Prisma","Location Id":594097,"URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190401-d594097-r931187328-Hotel_Exe_Prisma-Escaldes_Engordany_Escaldes_Engordany_Parish.html"}]
