But I have a story to tell you about this hotel that will explain how truly exceptional it is. Yesterday we watched as our home in the UK was broken into and we saw via our internal cameras 3 masked men trash our home. We were inconsolable. After 3 hours on the phone to the police we went to the bar for alcohol as we really were devastated. We ordered a lot of drinks in the next few hours as we told the staff why we were so upset. When we finally went to leave and to sign the check the staff refused to charge us a penny. What more can I say about this team ?

Just fantastic! The reception service, the availability and posture of the managers and messengers, the quality of the restaurants and service, the rooms and the structure for ski lovers. Worth highlighting the most sensational spa I've ever seen!","Helpful Votes":0,"Photos":null,"Stay Date":"2025-01-31","Created Date":"2025-02-02","Published Date":"2025-02-02","Language":"en","Location":"Sport Hotel Hermitage & Spa","Location Id":638418,"URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190404-d638418-r991947664-Sport_Hotel_Hermitage_Spa-Soldeu_Canillo_Parish.html"},{"Review Id":991827156,"User ID":"51A371C200938EE91B716F3D9A1713C8","Display Name":"Fernando R","User Name":"fernandorI9280VV","User Profile":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fernandorI9280VV","User Avatar":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg","User Location":null,"User Is Verified":"No","Rating":5,"Additional Ratings":"","Review Title":"Great for skiing!!!","Review Text":"Hotel with great cost benefit! Excellent breakfast! We went skiing with the family! We stayed in a large room with mountain views. The hotel has, in its building, boots rental, skiing, baseboards and classes. There is public parking, too. There's and gondolas that TV up to the top of the mantle to ski. I recommend!!!!","Helpful Votes":0,"Photos":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2e/b9/f4/e5/caption.jpg","Stay Date":"2025-01-31","Created Date":"2025-02-01","Published Date":"2025-02-01","Language":"en","Location":"Sport Hotel Hermitage & Spa","Location Id":638418,"URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g190404-d638418-r991827156-Sport_Hotel_Hermitage_Spa-Soldeu_Canillo_Parish.html"}]
