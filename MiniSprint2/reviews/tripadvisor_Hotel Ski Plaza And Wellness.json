The hotel facilities are fantastic, very comfortable and all super clean.\nBut definitely the best is the staff, all very polite, very friendly, always smiling, in good spirits and willing to help. This is really the main feature of why we choose to return to the Ski Plaza every year. All the staff are wonderful, starting with their director Nati, and following by their reception team (Candelaria, Juan, Gonzalo, Camila, Emilie), the bar (Gonzalo), the restaurant (Matías, Mili), the Spa (Agustina, fantastic massage therapist), and also the cleaning assistants. We are forgetting some names, but they are no less important in the day to day functioning of the place. We had a great time.

I think the least that could be offered is this service, free or at a symbolic cost. I am sure that thousands of guests would appreciate this and it would also be a reason to choose your hotel and not another, it should be a mandatory option.
