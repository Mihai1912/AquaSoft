Everything was solid and lived up to expectations, even if the stay was rather unspectacular – a classic “standard” that neither thrills nor disappoints. Of particular note is the extremely friendly and attentive staff who made our stay very pleasant. The pool area was a highlight: clean, relaxed and with always available cabanas – perfect for relaxing. The breakfast buffet was not huge, but the food offered was consistently delicious and of good quality. After a week, however, the choice seemed a bit limited. Overall, a solid stay that did not hold any big surprises, but convinced by friendliness and comfort.

And that's mainly because the information is just wrong. The photos are definitely outdated and when you put them on, you think you're coming to a top hotel. However, the hotel is extremely unusual and urgently needs a renovation. This hotel is definitely not taken care of and that is probably missing at all corners and ending. Views from terraces on rooftops are disastrous. Terraces are extremely dirty. Awnings are old, broken and dirty. The pool area looks like a bad two star hotel. It looks like Marriott just forgot about this hotel. The location is actually extremely good and you have a quiet walk to the mall and is actually located on the quieter side of town per se the hotel is really a very stylish place there much needed a complete renovation. I only give the two stars because the staff was extremely friendly and endeavoured and the cleaning staff probably goes to all efforts to clean the hotel at least halfway well. Unfortunately, there is probably little to distinguish between wear and dirt because it just looks catastrophic. Stains on the carpets and curtain holes in the walls, non-functioning technical items and extreme dust behind the TVs. Which already shows that there is no longer any ground being cleaned here and that for at least one to two years. This hotel could really be very good and make great money and here you would also pay a good price for the night if you get what you see in the photos. The staff are sorry that they are really trying hard and can probably do nothing more than watch the decay of this hotel. In the hotel are the Toto and the Tartell with two super restaurants which are not part of the hotel but are rented there and have super terraces and a great meal. I think these two probably won't be there much longer either if the hotel keeps falling into disrepair. It's just a shame not to use such a location properly.","Helpful Votes":0,"Photos":null,"Stay Date":"2025-05-31","Created Date":"2025-05-20","Published Date":"2025-05-20","Language":"en","Location":"Hotel Boulevard, Autograph Collection","Location Id":642623,"URL":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d642623-r1008452125-Hotel_Boulevard_Autograph_Collection-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html"},{"Review Id":1007177469,"User ID":"2BFB2141108C827F9DAD87B03FD28FA1","Display Name":"Joke O","User Name":"jokeo721","User Profile":"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jokeo721","User Avatar":"https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg","User Location":null,"User Is Verified":"No","Rating":5,"Additional Ratings":"Value:5\nRooms:4\nLocation:5\nCleanliness:5\nService:5\nSleep Quality:5","Review Title":"Great stay, professional staff","Review Text":"Ellie is very helpful and great team, supportive and assisting with our needs.
